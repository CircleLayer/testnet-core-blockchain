# Circle Layer Blockchain

## Introduction to Circle Layer
Circle Layer is a next-generation EVM-compatible blockchain designed for high performance, security, and scalability. It features AI-enhanced security protocols, high transaction throughput, and seamless integration with existing Ethereum infrastructure. Circle Layer uses an advanced Proof of Stake consensus mechanism optimized for energy efficiency and validator governance.

## Vision
Circle Layer is committed to advancing blockchain technology through innovation in AI-enhanced security, cross-chain interoperability, and scalable infrastructure. Our mission is to provide developers and enterprises with a robust, secure, and efficient blockchain platform that bridges traditional finance with decentralized applications.

## Circle Layer Testnet Performance
